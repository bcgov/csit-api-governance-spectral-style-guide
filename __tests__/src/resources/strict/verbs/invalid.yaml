    Example OpenAPI document containing both blacklisted and non-blacklisted verbs
    in realistic compound path segments using multiple casing conventions:
    • kebab-case (hyphenated)
    • camelCase
    • PascalCase
    • snake_case

    Every operation has a required description.
    Designed to test verb detection across all common path naming styles.
