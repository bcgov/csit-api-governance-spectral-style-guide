# Strict OpenAPI Style Guide

This Spectral ruleset extends the Basic OpenAPI Style Guide and applies stricter enforcement 
by elevating many recommended best practices to errors, adding mandatory content requirements, 
and enforcing stricter structural and documentation standards.

Key conventions and enforcements (in addition to all rules from the basic ruleset):

- All built-in best-practice rules from spectral:oas that were warnings are now errors
- Mandatory descriptions required for: info, tags, operations, parameters, schemas, requestBodies, headers, securitySchemes
- Minimum length requirements for most description fields
- Mandatory summaries required for: info (3.1), path items, and every operation
- Summaries must be plain text, single-line, no Markdown
- Summary must be shorter than description when both are present
- Enforced camelCase for operationId, path/query parameters, and schema properties
- Strict validation of Problem Details (RFC 9457) and internal error response structures
- No OAS 2.0 (must use OpenAPI 3.x)
- Examples required on all top-level schemas (OAS 3.0 & 3.1)
- Prefer `examples` (plural) over deprecated `example` in OAS 3.1

This ruleset is intended for teams that want very high-quality, consistent, 
well-documented, and code-generation-friendly OpenAPI definitions.
It prioritizes developer experience, automated tooling compatibility, 
and long-term maintainability.
